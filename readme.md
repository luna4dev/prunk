# Prunk.io Data Service

The backend API service for Prunk.io, rewritten in Go for performance and flexibility. This service provides the same API as the original Node.js/Serverless backend, but is designed to run on EC2 instances and is deployed via SSH.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Deployment**: Compiled binary deployed to EC2 via SSH
- **Database**: DynamoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Email Service**: AWS SES
- **Testing**: Go test
- **Linting**: golangci-lint

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- golangci-lint (for linting)
- SSH access to your EC2 deployment target

### Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (Go modules):
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Configure AWS credentials**:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   
   The service expects environment variables for AWS, JWT, and SES configuration. You can use a `.env` file or set them in your EC2 environment. Example variables:
   
   - `AWS_REGION`: AWS region
   - `DYNAMODB_TABLE_USERS`: DynamoDB users table name
   - `DYNAMODB_TABLE_PROJECTS`: DynamoDB projects table name
   - `DYNAMODB_TABLE_AUTHORIZATIONS`: DynamoDB authorizations table name
   - `EMAIL_AUTH_SENDER`: SES verified sender email
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT signing
   - `JWT_ISSUER`: JWT issuer
   - `JWT_AUDIENCE`: JWT audience
   - `SERVICE_DOMAIN`: Your domain name

4. **Set up AWS resources**:
   - **DynamoDB Tables**: Create tables with names starting with `Prunk` (e.g., `PrunkProjects`, `PrunkUsers`)
   - **SES Configuration**: Verify your email domain and set up SES for sending emails
   - **IAM Permissions**: Ensure your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions

5. **Build the service**:
   - For local development (macOS/arm64):
     ```bash
     make build
     ```
   - For production (Linux/amd64, for EC2):
     ```bash
     make build-prod
     ```
   - Binaries are output to the `bin/` directory.

6. **Run locally**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

7. **Test and lint**:
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   make fmt
   ```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Blue-Green Deployment System

This service includes a comprehensive blue-green deployment system that provides zero-downtime deployments with automatic health checks and rollback capabilities.

#### Deployment Scripts Overview

The deployment system consists of several scripts located in the `scripts/` directory:

- **`start-nginx.sh`** - Sets up Nginx reverse proxy and systemd services for blue-green deployment
- **`push-env.sh`** - Pushes environment variables to the remote server
- **`push-artifact.sh`** - Pushes the compiled binary to the remote server
- **`deploy-blue-green.sh`** - Performs blue-green deployment with health checks and traffic switching
- **`stop-nginx.sh`** - Stops Nginx completely
- **`reset-nginx.sh`** - Restarts Nginx (useful when environment variables change)

#### How It Works

1. **Two Service Instances**: Blue (port 8080) and Green (port 8081) run simultaneously
2. **Nginx Load Balancer**: Routes traffic between instances based on deployment state
3. **Health Checks**: Automatic verification that services are responding before traffic switching
4. **Zero Downtime**: New deployments are deployed to the inactive instance, then traffic is switched
5. **Automatic Rollback**: Failed deployments automatically revert to the previous working instance

#### Quick Start

1. **Initial Setup** (run once on your EC2 instance):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-nginx.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy Your Service**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor Health**:
   ```bash
   ssh user@server 'sudo /opt/prunk/health-check.sh'
   ```

For detailed documentation on all deployment scripts, see [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md).

### Manual Deployment

1. **Build the production binary**:
   ```bash
   make build-prod
   ```
   This creates `bin/data-service-linux`.

2. **Copy the binary to your EC2 instance via SSH**:
   ```bash
   scp -i <your-ec2-key.pem> bin/data-service-linux ec2-user@<ec2-ip>:/home/ec2-user/data-service
   ```

3. **SSH into your EC2 instance and run the service**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i <your-ec2-key.pem> ec2-user@<ec2-ip>
   chmod +x /home/ec2-user/data-service
   ./data-service
   ```
   Ensure your environment variables are set on the EC2 instance (via `.env` or systemd service, etc).

## üìö API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/email` - Request email authentication
- `GET /auth/email/verify` - Verify email authentication

### Projects

- `GET /project` - List user projects (requires authentication)
- `POST /project` - Create new project (requires authentication)
- `GET /project/{project_id}` - Get project details (requires authentication)

### Health Check

- `GET /health` - Service health check endpoint (required for blue-green deployment)

## üîê Security

### Authentication Flow

1. **Email Authentication**:
   - User requests authentication via email
   - System sends verification link to user's email
   - User clicks link to verify and receive JWT token
   - Token is used for subsequent API calls

2. **JWT Token Authorization**:
   - All protected endpoints require valid JWT token
   - Token is validated by the service
   - Token contains user information and permissions

### Security Features

- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- AWS IAM roles and policies for resource access
- Encrypted data transmission via HTTPS (when behind a reverse proxy)
- Input validation
- Rate limiting and debouncing for email requests

```

## üöÄ Deployment

### AWS Resources Required
